# Docs-as-Code Workshop

## Summary
This short workshop teaches developers how to write documentation alongside code using our existing tools.

## Context/Why
Documentation lives in the repository and is built by the CI pipeline.
A shared workflow keeps everything consistent and easy to maintain.

## Agenda
1. **Overview of docs-as-code** – why we version docs with the source.
2. **Style guide walkthrough** – highlight tone, formatting rules, and when to use each template.
3. **Using the templates** – start a new page from `docs/templates/` and fill in the required sections.
4. **PR workflow** – branch from `main`, commit Markdown changes, and open a pull request.
5. **Recording** – each session is recorded and shared in the portal for later viewing.

## Scheduling
Coordinate with each engineering team lead to book a 30‑minute session.
Use your preferred meeting platform and enable recording.
Upload the video to the internal portal and link it from the documentation.
