# Legacy Documentation Inventory

This page tracks our review of documentation sources from Confluence, Google Docs, and various wiki spaces.

## Context/Why

We want a single portal for accurate, up‑to‑date content. Auditing legacy docs helps us decide what to migrate, archive, or delete so you always find reliable information.
