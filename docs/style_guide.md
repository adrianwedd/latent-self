# Documentation Style Guide

This guide defines the tone and formatting conventions for all project documentation.
Follow these guidelines when creating or updating pages.

## Tone and Voice
- Write in a friendly, professional manner.
- Speak directly to the reader using **you**.
- Use active voice and keep sentences short.
- Explain the reasoning behind steps and decisions.
- Avoid unexplained jargon; define terms when first introduced.

## Formatting
- Author files in Markdown (`.md`).
- Begin each page with a level 1 heading.
- Use level 2 headings for major sections.
- Include a `Context/Why` section after the summary to set the stage.
- Keep line length under 120 characters where practical.
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers.
- Link to local documents using relative paths.

## Document Templates
Templates for common document types live in `docs/templates/`.
Each template contains placeholders, including a **Context/Why** section.

- **Tutorial** – step-by-step instructions to achieve a task.
- **Reference** – factual descriptions of commands, APIs or configuration.
- **Explanation** – background concepts or design reasoning.

Use these templates as a starting point for new documentation.
