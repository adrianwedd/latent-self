# Data Scientist

## Overview
A researcher exploring machine learning models integrated with the project.

## Goals
- Locate datasets and training scripts.
- Understand how to plug new models into the pipeline.
- Share experiment results with the team.

## Pain Points
- Build environment differences cause reproducibility issues.
- Sparse examples on customizing inference code.
- Model versioning guidelines are unclear.

## Primary Information Needs
- Location of curated datasets and data dictionaries.
- Steps for training and evaluating new models.
- Examples for integrating models into the pipeline.
- Reproducible environment setup and dependency management.
