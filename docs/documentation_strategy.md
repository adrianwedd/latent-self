# Documentation-as-a-Product Framework

## Product Owner

The Latent Self documentation is owned by **Jane Doe** (docs@example.com). All
feedback and improvement proposals are routed through this role.

## Mission and Vision

- **Mission**: Provide clear, discoverable and continuously updated
  documentation that empowers developers and curators to succeed quickly.
- **Vision**: Documentation is treated as a firstâ€‘class product, maintained and
  measured with the same care as the application code.

## Key Metrics

- Developer satisfaction survey score
- Time to first successful installation
- Search success rate in the portal
- Percentage of pull requests with accompanying docs
- Page views and search queries tracked via Plausible

A small dashboard summarising these metrics is published in the portal.

## Q3/Q4 Roadmap

1. Launch the central documentation portal and migrate existing content.
2. Publish a style guide and templates for all document types.
3. Automate API reference generation for services.
4. Integrate feedback widgets and triage workflow.


## Audience Personas

The docs target several developer personas. Refer to [Developer Personas](personas/index.md) for detailed profiles outlining goals and pain points for each group.
